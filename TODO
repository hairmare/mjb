poor mans project plan

* make it easy (ie well documented) to configure mpdas and networking (wlan)
* automounting of sd cards and usb hds complete with mpd integration
* pympdtouchgui default config tweaks and maybe some skinning
* clean avahi integration for mpd
* mpd streaming (vorbis)
* fix for egalax touchscreen
** commit patchset to local rep
* libsdl-image jpg and png support fix
* cleanup tslib integration with nice pkg with ts_calibrate and firstrun stuffs
* test from documented update process
* streamline distro publishing process
** only one hardware type to consider for now
* build protoype case
* refactor power supply so i only need one power brick
** maybe the Alix is up to this -> grab 5V for USB hib from there?
** 12V for screen
** 12-18V for Alix
** 5V for USB Hub
* write user manual that is easy enough that even a drunk in a bar might grasp the box
** leaflet format with a heavily graphical presentation
** a bit like the safety card in planes
* add bluetooth support
* fix routing things after testing what interface to use for getting through the big fat wall in the first boxes home
* simple web gui
** i found none that look as simple as pympdtouchgui
** i only want minimal features and no bells or whistles
** add links for downloading recommended clients
** open up web access for said downloads (ie only app store things work on the iPhone)
* create a list of compatible client devices
* lirc support?
